Some key preprocessing treatments included:
1. Parsed ‘LActive_date’ column and extracted year, month, day, hour and minute value, and created new attributes/columns to store those values, by using ‘as.Date’ and ‘strptime’ functions in R.

2. Identified different ways missing values were encoded in the dataset for different columns, and standardized them with ‘NA’ that R recognizes.

3. Some categorical variables were encoded using ‘if-else’ logic statement for better interpretability. These variables included,
  a. Encoded ‘LActive_year’ column as binary attribute with 1 (active this year/2015, given this dataset was from 2015) or 0 (active last year/2014). The rationale was that the model is created to predict future events, therefore, the actual number of ‘2014’ or ‘2015’ would not matter
  b. Encoded ‘LActive_month’ column as binary attribute with ‘Winter’ and ‘Summer’
  c. Encoded ‘LActive_day’ as binary attribute with ‘WK’ (Weekday) and ‘WD’ (Weekend)
  d. ‘LActive_hour’ was encoded as 1: (Yes, during work hour) and 0: (No, off-work hour)
  e. ‘Breed_Type’ was encoded as 1: (Yes, pure breed) and 0
  f. ‘Country’ was encoded as 1: (Within U.S.) and 0. Before encoding the columns, value frequency was examined. In this case, ‘U.S.’ is the most occuring state in the dataset
  g. ‘State’ was encoded as 1: (User from/lives in California) and 0. Before encoding the columns, value frequency was examined. In this case, ‘CA’ is the most occuring state in the dataset

4. Considering the possibility that missing value itself might be an insightful indicator of some kind, columns with less concerning percentages of missing values were treated by explicitly adding ‘NA’ as a factor level. This was done by using ‘fct_explicit_na’ function in ‘forcats’ library

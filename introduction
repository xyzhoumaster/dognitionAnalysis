Dognition offers a subscription-based service to dog lovers who look for more effective ways of building a deeper connection with their dogs. 
By subscribing to the service via its website, dognition users receive 20 games and activities by videos——developed by interdisciplinary experts
in animal training and behavioral science—–that they can follow to play with their dogs.

The assessments are designed to capture and understand how a dog interacts with the world and communicates with its surroundings. Then based on
the results of those assessments, a dog’s personality can be revealed and realized. Dognition assigns a dog with one of its nine profiles,
including ACE, Charmer, Socialite, Expert, Renaissance Dog, Protodog, Einstein, Maverick and Stargazer.

In order to design new activities that serve users’ interest and fulfill the organization’s purpose, Dognition wants to be able to collect as much 
data as possible with respect to a variety kinds of dogs. Therefore, one of its primary goal is to find out what factors contribute to users’ 
(and their dogs) completion of the assessments.
